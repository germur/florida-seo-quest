      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-primary mb-6">When Smoke Disguised as the Future</h2>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        In 2016, Gartner launched a headline that spread like wildfire: "By 2020, 30% of searches will be screenless." A year later, ComScore added more fuel: "Half of all searches will be voice-based."
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The promise sounded irresistible. Who wouldn't want to get ahead of the revolution?
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The media amplified it. Marketing gurus presented it at conferences as the next extinction of traditional SEO. And thousands of companies moved budgets to jump on the wave.

    </p>
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      In 2020, less than 20% of users in the U.S. used voice as their regular channel (DemandSage, 2025).
    </p>
    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
      And most did it for trivial things: "Alexa, play music," "Siri, what's the weather like today?"

      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The same thing happened with visual search.
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        When Pinterest launched Lens in 2017 and Google bet on Google Lens, the headlines were apocalyptic: "The camera will replace words."
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">And it's true, the numbers are impressive:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li>Pinterest Lens registers more than 600 million monthly searches (VentureBeat, 2018).</li>
        <li>Google Lens exceeds 8 billion searches per month (Google Ads & Commerce Blog, 2024).</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        But behind those brilliant figures, reality is different: most queries are about fashion, decoration, or lifestyle (ORR Consulting).
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        If you're a lawyer, doctor, or financial consultant, Lens isn't your new sales channel.
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">Hype shines like fireworks. Loud, dazzling, but ephemeral.</p>

        Then came AEO (Answer Engine Optimization).
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The name already seemed designed to sell consultancies. "The future of SEO," they called it.
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The thesis: answer engines like Alexa or Siri would displace Google, and only those who optimized for AEO would survive.
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The real data is less spectacular: only 11.84% of global searches show featured snippets (Ahrefs).
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Nine out of ten searches don't even participate in the supposed "market of the future."
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        AEO ended up being what many suspected: more marketing smoke than technological revolution.

        Saying that voice or visual "don't work" would be as irresponsible as the predictions we criticize.
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Voice does matter for local searches ("near me"), accessibility, and immediate tasks.
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Visual is pure gold for e-commerce in fashion, decoration, and physical products (ORR Consulting).

      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Even AEO, though limited, can be strategic in industries where snippets dominate (Stephan Spencer).
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The problem isn't with the technology. The problem is selling it as if it were the new gospel, when in reality they are specific pieces within a much broader puzzle.

      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">

      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Agencies started selling "Voice SEO packages." Consultants filled conferences with slides saying "The keyboard will die."
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The result: thousands of businesses invested time and money expecting a 2020 where users would talk more than they typed.
      </p>
      
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong class="text-electric-blue">ðŸ“Œ Reality was much more modest:</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        According to data collected in 2020, less than 20% of users in the U.S. used voice habitually to search the internet (DemandSage, 2025).
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        And of those, most did it for simple things: "What's the weather like today?", "Play Wendy Sulca music", "Call mom".
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mb-4">Why didn't voice take off?</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Context limitations:</strong> Talking to your phone isn't always comfortable or viable. In public transport, at the office, or even at home with more people around, dictating a search can be invasive.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy and trust:</strong> Users still distrust having an open microphone listening all the time. Cases like Alexa saving private conversations generated distrust.</li>
        <li><strong>Complexity in transactional searches:</strong> One thing is asking Siri for the game time. Another very different is choosing medical insurance or buying a computer. Voice is excellent for micro-queries, but insufficient for complex processes.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mb-4">Where voice does contribute: local</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li>"Dentist near me"</li>
        <li>"Best pizza near me"</li>
        <li>"Gas station near me"</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        58% of consumers in the U.S. declared having used voice searches to find local businesses (DemandSage, 2025).
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Here voice makes perfect sense: you're moving, you're in a hurry, you need an immediate result.
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong class="text-electric-blue">ðŸ“Œ For a restaurant, gym, or hardware store, optimizing for voice (with correct data in Google Business Profile, reviews, and well-structured FAQs) is indeed a profitable strategy.</strong>
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mb-4">Voice commerce: high noise, low adoption</h3>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        For years there was talk of "voice commerce" as the next big e-commerce disruption.
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">But the data tells another story:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li>Only 2% of Alexa owners in the U.S. used the device to make purchases regularly (Forbes).</li>
        <li>And of that 2%, most limited themselves to recurring products like diapers, detergent, or pet food.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong class="text-electric-blue">ðŸ“Œ Nobody buys an $800 TV by talking to Alexa. Nobody decides their new health plan with a voice command.</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Voice commerce exists, but it's marginal and limited to low-risk products.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mb-4">Voice as layer, not substitute</h3>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The error was selling voice as a substitute for SEO, when in reality it's a complementary layer.
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">For locals, voice + "near me" is vital.</p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">For global brands, voice is one more channel, useful for reminders, FAQs, or simple tasks.</p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">For complex sectors (health, legal, B2B), its impact is almost irrelevant.</p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">It's a reminder that in digital marketing, absolute promises usually hide smoke.</p>

      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Imagine a user searching for "how to file taxes as a freelancer in the U.S."
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Are they really going to ask Alexa and trust a single paragraph response?
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Reality is they'll end up in a complete article, an explanatory video, or a step-by-step tutorial.
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">Voice is the beginning of the conversation, not the end of the funnel.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mb-4">What we learned from the voice hype</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Not everything that shines is revolution:</strong> The numbers that sounded so round (30%, 50%) became easy headlines, but never had backing in real use.</li>
        <li><strong>Optimize without losing your head:</strong> It's worth ensuring your local business is optimized for voice searches. It's not worth redesigning your entire SEO strategy around Alexa or Siri.</li>
        <li><strong>SEO is still SEO:</strong> Even in voice, the principle doesn't change: Google, Siri, or Alexa respond with the best structured and most reliable information (Google Developers â€“ Search Central).</li>

      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">Today, more than 7 years later, it's worth reviewing what happened.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mb-4">The numbers that dazzle</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li>Google Lens processes more than 8 billion searches per month (Google Ads & Commerce Blog, 2024).</li>
        <li>Pinterest Lens exceeds 600 million monthly searches (VentureBeat, 2018).</li>
        <li>74% of consumers affirm that visual search influences their purchase decision in verticals like fashion and decoration (ORR Consulting).</li>
        <li>In e-commerce, 36% of online shoppers have used visual search functions at some point (eMarketer).</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">On paper, the data seems to confirm what the gurus predicted: visual is enormous.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mb-4">The context that cools the data</h3>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">But numbers need context:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Concentrated in specific verticals:</strong> fashion, home and decoration, beauty, and easily identifiable physical products.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        A Gartner study showed that less than 8% of visual queries are made in sectors outside retail or lifestyle.
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        That is, if you're a lawyer, financial consultant, or sell SaaS, visual won't bring you clients tomorrow.
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Aspirational bias:</strong> Much of visual searches on Pinterest are aspirational: users saving fashion, decoration, or recipe ideas. The step to purchase is much weaker than in a textual search like "buy Nike shoes size 10".</li>
        <li><strong>Cultural and technological barrier:</strong> Although the camera is in all smartphones, less than 17% of Google users in the U.S. used Lens monthly in 2022 (eMarketer).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mb-4">Where visual is gold</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Retail and fashion:</strong> A user sees a dress on the street, photographs it, and finds similar options online.</li>
        <li><strong>Decoration:</strong> You point the camera at a piece of furniture and discover where to buy it or how to combine it.</li>
        <li><strong>Travel and culture:</strong> With Lens you can identify monuments, plants, animals, or tourist places in seconds.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong class="text-electric-blue">ðŸ“Œ For an e-commerce of clothes or furniture, ignoring visual search would be losing an emerging channel of highly qualified traffic.</strong>
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mb-4">When the camera wins... and when it doesn't</h3>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">Think about the difference:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Text:</strong> you write "Nike black sneakers size 10".</li>
        <li><strong>Visual:</strong> you point the camera at your friend's sneakers and find similar models instantly.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The second experience seems futuristic, but it only applies to contexts where the product is clearly recognizable. It's hard to imagine someone using Lens to search for "programmatic SEO strategy" or "labor lawyer in Miami".
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Visual, then, is not a substitute for SEO, but an accelerator in specific sectors.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mb-4">Why massive adoption didn't arrive</h3>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Why, with such large numbers, hasn't visual search displaced traditional SEO?
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Habit weighs more than innovation:</strong> Writing continues to be more natural for 80% of queries. To ask "best health insurance in Florida," text remains the logical route.</li>
        <li><strong>Difficulty in abstract searches:</strong> Many queries cannot be represented with images: "How to build topical authority in SEO," "Most profitable pension plan," "Best philosophy books in 2024".</li>
        <li><strong>Inflated data bias:</strong> That Google Lens has 8 billion queries doesn't mean 8 billion buyers. Many searches are educational, curious, or recreational, not transactional.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mb-4">Practical lessons to decide if it suits you</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Not every sector should run:</strong> If you're in fashion, decoration, or physical products, integrate visual search now. If you're in B2B or complex services, prioritize classic SEO.</li>
        <li><strong>SEO still governs the funnel:</strong> Visual helps in discovery, but closing and conversion continue to be in textual searches and well-optimized content.</li>
        <li><strong>Marketing should read intention:</strong> The error is obsessing over the tool. The key is asking: What is my user looking for? How do they search? What channel is most natural to solve it?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-primary mb-6">AEO: Expensive Revolution or Pretty Label?</h2>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        In 2018, a new term appeared strongly at SEO and marketing conferences: AEO â€“ Answer Engine Optimization.
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The message was clear and alarmist: "SEO died, now only those who optimize for answer engines like Alexa, Siri, or Google Assistant will survive."
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        It was sold as an inevitable truth. The future was no longer ten blue links on Google, but a single spoken answer that would define winners and losers.
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Fear spread like gunpowder: what would happen to a website that wasn't "the" answer?
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mb-4">The numbers that deflate the discourse</h3>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        In practice, AEO was reduced to an obsession with featured snippets (the famous "position 0" on Google).
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong>ðŸ“Š But the numbers deflate the discourse:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li>Only 11.84% of global searches show a featured snippet (Ahrefs).</li>
        <li>Most snippets appear in simple informational queries, like "what is blockchain" or "how many bones does the human body have".</li>
        <li>According to an Ahrefs study, more than 70% of snippets don't generate additional clicks, because the user gets the answer on Google without visiting any site.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        That is: the supposed "AEO revolution" was based on less than 12% of searches, in basic questions and with little conversion potential.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mb-4">The fuel of AEO: the mirage of assistants</h3>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">Much of the AEO hype came from voice assistants.</p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">The narrative was simple: "If Alexa will only give one answer, you must be that answer."</p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">But usage data from Alexa and Google Assistant reveal that:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li>More than 70% of interactions with voice assistants are related to music, weather, reminders, or trivial questions (OC&C Strategy Consultants).</li>
        <li>Less than 2% of Alexa users in the U.S. make recurring purchases with the device (Forbes).</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Was it really worth investing thousands of dollars in AEO to be on a channel where most people only ask to play "Safaera" by Bad Bunny or to tell them if, according to Mercury retrograde, they're getting back with their boyfriend?
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mb-4">The "unique answer": good story, bad decision</h3>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Imagine an insurance company that pays for a complete AEO consultancy to appear on Alexa.
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">The user asks: "What's the best health insurance in Miami?"</p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Alexa doesn't deliver a comparator. It doesn't analyze coverage, prices, reviews, or real cases. It simply responds with a simplified snippet taken from some source.
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">The result: the information is incomplete, biased, and unreliable.</p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The user, not being satisfied, returns to Google, compares several options, and makes the decision as they always have: reading, researching, and contrasting.
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong class="text-electric-blue">ðŸ“Œ Moral: the "unique answer" is attractive in theory, but insufficient in complex searches that require context, nuances, and trust.</strong>
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mb-4">How fear was sold (and charged dearly)</h3>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">The strength of AEO didn't come from its real impact, but from its ability to sell fear.</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li>Consultants presented it as "the end of SEO".</li>
        <li>Agencies offered exclusive packages for "optimization for answer engines".</li>
        <li>Startups were created solely to sell AEO tools.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">The term sounded technical, futuristic, and urgent. And in marketing, those three words open wallets.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mb-4">What to do with snippets (without selling your soul)</h3>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">Does this mean snippets don't work? No.</p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">Optimizing for them can bring benefits:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li>Greater visibility in results.</li>
        <li>Possibility of capturing users in informative stage.</li>
        <li>Brand reinforcement by being perceived as authority.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">But the error is selling it as a total revolution.</p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">The snippet is just one more piece in the SEO ecosystem. A bonus within a content strategy, not the center of it.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mb-4">Lessons to not bite the hook</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li><strong>Acronyms sell more than data:</strong> AEO was basically SEO focused on snippets. But giving it a new acronym turned it into a global trend.</li>
        <li><strong>Users don't change so fast:</strong> Although Google, Alexa, or Siri show direct answers, users continue researching, comparing, and validating sources.</li>
        <li><strong>SEO remains integral:</strong> No "trend" substitutes the base strategy: architecture, search intention, topical authority, and user experience.</li>
      </ul>

    <section id="conclusion-seo-that-works">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-primary mb-6">Conclusion: The SEO That Works in 2025 (and 2030)</h2>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        During the last decade, we've seen acronyms and supposed revolutions parade by: Voice (VEO), Visual (VSEO), AEO, and those that will come tomorrow with new acronyms.
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">Each time the narrative was the same: "SEO died, now everything is different."</p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        But if data, failures, and mirages teach us anything, it's that SEO never died.
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        It changed, evolved, adapted, but the essence has always been the same: solving the real need of a user.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mb-4">Why we fallâ€”and how to avoid it</h3>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">Why do we fall again and again into the same traps?</p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">Because smoke sells easier than constant work.</p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">Telling a client "we need 6 months of solid strategy" doesn't excite.</p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">Telling them "there's a new revolution, if you don't get on the train today, you die" does open wallets.</p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        This is how acronyms are born that end up being trending topics at conferences but irrelevant in practice.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mb-4">The only thing Google always wants: answers</h3>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong class="text-electric-blue">ðŸ“Œ Google doesn't want revolutions. It wants answers (Google Developers â€“ Search Central).</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Its business depends on users finding what they're looking for as quickly as possible.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li>If you use voice, Google wants to give you a brief and useful answer.</li>
        <li>If you use visual, Google wants to show you relevant images.</li>
        <li>If you ask an assistant, Google (or Alexa) wants to return something reliable.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">In all cases, what does Google need?</p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong class="text-electric-blue">ðŸ‘‰ Clear, structured, reliable content that solves the intention.</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">That is, SEO.</p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mb-4">The pattern of the invented funeral</h3>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">Voice was hype that ended up being useful only in local contexts.</p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">Visual is pure gold in retail and lifestyle, but marginal in other sectors.</p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">AEO was basically snippets sold as revolution.</p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">All three shared the same pattern:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li>Exaggeration at conferences and media.</li>
        <li>Agencies selling "exclusive" packages.</li>
        <li>Limited practical results.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        The moral is simple: <strong>SEO doesn't die, but every so often someone invents a funeral to sell coffins.</strong>
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mb-4">The brand that didn't chase smoke (and won)</h3>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">Imagine you own an e-commerce.</p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        They tell you that you need to invest thousands in "optimization for answer engines" because "people no longer write, they only speak."
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Then they tell you everything will be visual, that "the future is pointing with the camera."
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Later that AEO is all that matters, that "without snippet you don't exist."
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Years pass, and meanwhile your competitionâ€”who didn't chase the smokeâ€”dedicated themselves to:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li>Understanding their audience.</li>
        <li>Creating content that really helped.</li>
        <li>Building authority in their niche (Dejan.ai).</li>
        <li>Optimizing their website with solid foundations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">In all cases, what does Google need?</p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong class="text-electric-blue">ðŸ‘‰ Clear, structured, reliable content that solves the intention.</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">That is, SEO.</p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Result: they keep growing, while you accumulated consultancy bills that never changed anything.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mb-4">Your real advantage: critical thinking</h3>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        What separates businesses that succeed from those that fall into the trap is the ability to think critically.
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">Not getting carried away by trends, and instead asking:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li>Does this add value to my user?</li>
        <li>Does it solve a real problem?</li>
        <li>Does it fit my strategy or is it just a distraction?</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mb-4">Roadmap: intention, architecture, authority, trust</h3>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">The SEO that matters in 2025 (and 2030) is the same that mattered in 2010:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li>Understanding search intention.</li>
        <li>Structuring a clear and navigable site.</li>
        <li>Creating topical and brand authority (Dejan.ai).</li>
        <li>Giving trust with data, experience, and consistency (Google E-E-A-T).</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Everything elseâ€”voice, visual, AEO, the acronym they invent tomorrowâ€”are layers. Complements. Useful tools in some contexts, but never substitutes for strategy.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary mb-4">What to remember (and what to ignore) from today</h3>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">If you should remember anything from this entire journey, it's this:</p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong class="text-electric-blue">ðŸ‘‰ SEO is not smoke. The smoke is the shortcuts they want to sell us disguised as revolutions.</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">The only real revolution is returning to the essential:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li>Know your audience.</li>
        <li>Create for them.</li>
        <li>Be more useful, clearer, and more reliable than the competition.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">SEO will remain alive as long as there are people with questions and businesses willing to answer them.</p>
