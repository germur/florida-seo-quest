    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
      It's Monday morning. You pour coffee, open your laptop, and check your Google Search Console reports. What you see makes your blood run cold: the impression graph has fallen off a cliff, your average position has "improved" to an unbelievable degree, but your clicks remain stable. Your first reaction is pure panic. "What did I do wrong? Did Google penalize me? Are we losing massive visibility?"
    </p>

    <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">
      This scenario, the nightmare of many SEO professionals, unfolded during the second week of September 2025. The culprit wasn't an algorithm change or a penalty, but something far more subtle and confusing: Google silently deactivated the <code>&num=100</code> query parameter. While this didn't affect your real rankings, it did radically change how your metrics were reported.
    </p>

    <section id="mystery-num100">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-primary mb-6">üîç The Mystery of &num=100: Who Was It and Why Did It Disappear?</h2>
      
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        To understand the panic, we first need to know what this parameter was. In a normal search, Google shows you about 10 organic results per page. But if you were an SEO or a tool, you could add <code>&num=100</code> to the SERP URL to force Google to show you the top 100 results on a single page.
      </p>

      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        This practice was bread and butter for many crawling, auditing, and <a href="/services/seo-audit" class="text-electric-blue hover:underline">keyword tracking tools</a>. It allowed them to quickly and efficiently collect large volumes of ranking and impression data.
      </p>

      <div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-yellow-50 to-orange-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-400 p-6 mb-6 rounded-r-lg">
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-yellow-800 mb-3">‚ö†Ô∏è So, what happened?</h3>
        <p class="text-yellow-700 mb-3">
          Around September 10-14, this "trick" simply stopped working consistently. Google confirmed it's not a formally supported parameter.
        </p>
      </div>

      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        <strong class="text-electric-blue">And why did Google do it?</strong> The SEO community has three strong theories:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3 mb-8">
        <li>
          <strong>Reducing mass scraping:</strong> Hundreds of tools and bots used <code>&num=100</code> to download massive volumes of data with a single request. This put unnecessary load on Google's servers. By eliminating it, Google cleans up artificial traffic.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Purifying Search Console data:</strong> By removing impressions from very deep positions (like 95 or 99) that virtually no human user ever sees, the reports become more faithful to real user behavior. It's like Google is removing "ghosts" from your report that were inflating your impressions without providing any value.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ending "impression inflation":</strong> Over the last year, many of us noticed that impressions were disproportionately increasing in Search Console without a corresponding growth in clicks. An emerging theory is that much of this increase was generated by bots using <code>&num=100</code>. By deactivating it, that artificial "inflation" disappears. Your data isn't worse; it's just more honest.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
        Here's where many people got confused. The data looked catastrophic, but real visibility and <a href="/services/organic-seo" class="text-electric-blue hover:underline">organic traffic</a> remained stable. This is the drama that played out in the reports:
