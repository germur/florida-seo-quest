        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">WordPress is, without a doubt, one of the most popular platforms for building websites. It is estimated to power more than <strong class="text-purple">40% of all sites on the Internet</strong>, and its reputation as a free and easy-to-use tool convinces many entrepreneurs with limited budgets that it is the best option for any project. The common narrative presents WordPress as the ideal solution for those who need a website that is inexpensive and quick to launch.</p>
      
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">However, is WordPress really the panacea it promises to be? In practice, many experienced professionals have discovered that, far from being a smooth path, WordPress often generates more conflicts and problems than solutions when not managed properly. Below, we explore why in many cases WordPress can become an obstacle to scaling a digital project, and how its popularity has given rise to bad practices and empty promises in the web development industry.</p>

        Constant Maintenance and Frequent Updates
      </h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">One of the first disadvantages faced by WordPress users is the ongoing maintenance it requires. Unlike a fully custom-built website that may remain more static, a WordPress site demands regular attention. WordPress does not maintain itself: it is necessary to update the system core, themes, and plugins regularly, and even review content periodically. If these tasks are not performed, problems soon begin to appear.</p>
      
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">Every new version of WordPress or any plugin can introduce incompatibilities that break existing features. Skipping updates "for convenience" is not an option: it risks accumulating security vulnerabilities or serious errors over time.</p>
      
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">Moreover, the updates themselves can create conflicts. It is advisable to make backups before updating and check compatibility of each new version with the rest of the site's ecosystem. Many users learn this the hard way: after a major update, certain parts of the website stop working, or the dreaded "white screen" appears.</p>

            <p class="font-semibold text-red mb-2">⚠️ Reality Check</p>
            <p class="mb-0"><strong>In practical terms, owning a WordPress site is like owning a car that constantly needs to go to the shop:</strong> there is always a plugin asking for an update, or a warning in the dashboard like a check-engine light. Ignoring those "lights" and skipping maintenance is driving straight toward a breakdown.</p>

        Conclusion
      </h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">WordPress is not inherently bad, but it is often presented as a universal solution when it is actually a tool with very specific limitations and requirements. For many projects, especially those seeking long-term scalability and professional performance, WordPress can become more of a problem than a solution.</p>
      
      <p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">The key is to understand that <strong class="text-purple">there is no magic solution in web development</strong>. Each project has unique needs, and the choice of technology should be based on a realistic analysis of resources, objectives, and technical capabilities.</p>
      
      <p class="leading-relaxed">Before choosing WordPress, honestly evaluate whether you have the time, knowledge, and budget necessary to maintain it properly. Sometimes, investing in a custom solution or a more robust platform from the start can save significant headaches and costs in the long run.</p>
